## pseudocode Project Euler 18

#### THE LOGIC
we should not try to find all solutions by mapping them instead we need to go through the problem in a way that we should evaluate each path without brute forcing
#### REMARK
we need to be careful that some paths can be disadvantages first but later on might give the biggest outcome so when we are calculating the result we also need to check those
